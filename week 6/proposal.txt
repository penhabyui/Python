CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
CNC Laser Cutting Optimization Tool

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
The program will help optimize the cutting process for iron pieces used in assembling chairs and tables. 
It will calculate the number of parts that can be cut from a standard 6000 mm iron bar, considering varying sizes and optimize cutting time.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
You will gain a deeper understanding of programming logic and optimization techniques specific to CNC laser cutting operations. 
This includes managing material efficiency, minimizing waste, and optimizing production schedules.

4. What Python modules will your program use?
csv
math (for calculations)
datetime (for handling dates and times, if needed

5. List the names of functions you will need?

calculate_pieces_per_bar(bar_length, piece_length): Calculates the number of pieces that can be cut from a given bar length based on the size of each piece.
calculate_bars_needed(desired_pieces, pieces_per_bar): Determines the number of bars needed to cut a specified number of pieces based on the calculated pieces per bar.
calculate_total_time(bars_needed, time_per_bar_minutes): Calculates the total cutting time required based on the number of bars needed and the time per bar.

6. List the names of the test functions you will write.
test_calculate_pieces_per_bar: Tests the calculate_pieces_per_bar function with different inputs to ensure accurate calculation of pieces per bar.
test_calculate_bars_needed: Tests the calculate_bars_needed function to verify it correctly calculates the number of bars required for a given number of pieces.
test_calculate_total_time: Tests the calculate_total_time function to ensure it accurately computes the total cutting time based on the number of bars and time per bar
